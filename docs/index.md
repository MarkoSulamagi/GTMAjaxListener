# Intro

A GTM tag that pushes data from AJAX forms into data layer. 

This is an upgraded version of a widely used Lunametrics AJAX listener. Lunametrics' version of the script has been 
working very well over the years, but with the rise of the 
[Single Page applications]([https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-single-page-application-in-web-development]) (SPAs) 
the script oftentimes
doesn't work.

This is usually caused by missing jQuery library that Lunametrics' script depends on. Use the upgraded script to 
get past this problem.

# Get Started

## How to configure new GTM account

There are 2 options you can use to integrate the script.

#### Option 1: Import tags and variables using our container script (suggested).

Importing a container script is the quickest way to get started. It will automatically create a custom HTML tag with 
all the required variables into your GTM account for you to use. 

1. <a href="/downloads/gtm-import-ajax-listener-marxdev.json" download>Download container file</a>
2. Open your account in Google Tag Manager and navigate to **Admin -> Import Container**.
4. **Choose the downloaded file** and select **Existing workspace**.
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Set **Choose an import option** to **Merge** with **Overwrite conflicting tags, triggers and variables**.  
_Merging containers will make sure your existing tags, triggers and variables will stay in place and you won't lose 
any of your previous configuration._
6. See that you have **1 new tag** and **13 new variables**.
7. Confirm the import and see the custom HTML tag and variables in your workspace.

**Next learn [how to use AJAX listener](#how-to-use-ajax-listener).**

#### Option 2: Configure a custom HTML tag and variables manually.

More advanced users can set up the tag and variables themselves without using the pre-built script.

1. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarkoSulamagi/gtm-ajax-listener/master/ajax-listener.html" target="_blank">
Copy the script</a>
2. Create a **custom HTML tag**, name it "AJAX Listener". Paste the script to HTML input field and set the tag to 
trigger on **All Pages**
3. Use the 
<a href="https://www.analyticsmania.com/google-tag-manager-ajax-form-tracking" target="_blank">Analytics Mania</a> tutorial
to set up custom variables. 

## How to switch from Lunametrics AJAX listener

Differences between Lunametrics listener and this script are minimal and switching them 
shouldn't take more then a minute. 

All GTM variables that were working with Lunametrics keep working as is and there's no need to change any of them. 
**The only thing you need to do is replace the custom HTML tag with 
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarkoSulamagi/gtm-ajax-listener/master/ajax-listener.html" target="_blank">
this script</a>**. Once this is done then everything should work as it did before.

## FAQ

#### Why doesn't Lunametrics script work?

Lunametrics depends on a javascript library called <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a>. 
This means that if your website developers haven't included jQuery in the website code then Lunametrics 
ajax listener script will not work.

This problem is more common with 
<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-single-page-application-in-web-development" target="_blank">Single Page applications</a>.

The easiest way to find out if your website has jquery enabled is to ask the developers. 
Another option is to use a <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-know-where-jQuery-is-used-in-a-website" target="_blank">browser console</a>

This script is dependency free and should work regardless of what technology the website is built 
with.

#### How to use AJAX Listener

The tag is modified from a frequently used Lunametrics script. Everything that works with Lunametrics tag 
will keep working the same way.
